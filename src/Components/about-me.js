            <p id="reading-paragraph">When I'm not playing video games, I love to read. I love most genres, but my favorites are fantasy 
                and science fiction. My favorite author is Ray Bradbury, and I even have a rocketship tattoo in honor of him!

            <p id="music-paragraph">Another one of my hobbies is playing music. I have been playing the piano since I was 8 years old. 
                I taught myself how to play the guitar when I was in highschool, and now that is my instrument of choice! I play a pink
                Fender Stratocaster, just like the one in the image.
